ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kathatherine, a senior tech writer at Anaconda. You can get ahold of me at kkinnaman@anaconda.com.

I primarily work on docs for Anaconda's free offering, Anaconda Distribution, but I'm also on the team that contributes to the [conda organization](https://github.com/conda), including some projects in the [conda incubator](https://github.com/conda-incubator).
